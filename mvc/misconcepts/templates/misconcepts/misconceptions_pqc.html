            <h2>QKD vs. PQC: Common Misconception</h2>
            <p>
                <b>Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)</b> refers to cryptographic algorithms designed to be secure against attacks from quantum computers. PQC is implemented in software and can run on existing computers and networks, making it practical
                for widespread adoption. Its goal is to replace or supplement current encryption methods (like RSA and ECC) that could be broken by quantum computers in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)</b> is a method of securely sharing encryption keys using the principles of quantum physics. Unlike traditional key exchange methods that rely on mathematical problems, QKD uses quantum particles (like
                photons) to transmit information. If anyone tries to intercept the key, the act of measuring the quantum particles disturbs them, alerting the communicating parties to potential eavesdropping. QKD requires specialized hardware and is mainly
                used for highly secure communication channels.
            </p>
            <p>People often think "quantum cryptography" means it's secure against quantum attacks. <br> But QKD is not PQC. QKD uses quantum tech; PQC protects against quantum tech. Just because it says ‚Äúquantum‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs secure against quantum
                computers. In short: <strong>QKD</strong> = encryption with quantum tech. <strong>PQC</strong> = encryption against quantum tech. Understanding this difference helps us to be better for a quantum future.</p>

            <h2>QKD vs. PQC: Difference</h2>
            <p><strong>Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)</strong> and <strong>Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)</strong> both address the challenge of securing information in the age of quantum computing‚Äîbut they approach it in fundamentally different ways, and
                are often mistakenly conflated.<br><br> QKD leverages the principles of quantum physics to securely distribute encryption keys. Rather than relying on complex mathematical problems (as traditional cryptography does), QKD uses quantum particles‚Äîtypically
                photons‚Äîto transmit key information. The key feature is that any attempt to intercept the transmission disturbs the quantum state, immediately revealing the presence of an eavesdropper. However, QKD requires specialized infrastructure
                such as quantum-enabled fiber optics or satellites, which limits its scalability and practical deployment.<br><br> PQC, in contrast, is a software-based solution designed to withstand attacks from powerful quantum computers. It involves
                creating new cryptographic algorithms that remain secure even if quantum computers can break current standards like <strong>RSA</strong>. Importantly, PQC algorithms can run on existing devices and networks, making them more accessible
                and scalable for widespread adoption.<br><br>

            <h2>Diffie-hellman: Classical Cryptography Key Distribution</h2>
            <p>Alice wants to send a secret message to Bob. To keep it safe, she needs to lock it with a "key" ‚Äî like a password. But Bob needs the same key to decrypt (read) it. The big problem? How do Alice and Bob share this secret key without someone
                else seeing it? In classical cryptography, they need to find a secure way to share the key first. That could mean: Meeting in person and writing it down. Sending it by trusted courier. Calling on a secure phone. Once Bob has the key, Alice
                can encrypt her message, and Bob can decrypt it. But if anyone (like Eve, the eavesdropper) gets the key, she can also read the message. So, the key distribution problem is: How do Alice and Bob share the key secretly in the first place?
                That‚Äôs why classical methods can be risky ‚Äî if the key is intercepted during sharing, the whole system is broken.</p>

            <h2>BB84: Quantum Cryptography Key Distribution</h2>
            <p>
                <p>Imagine you are <strong>Alice</strong> and you want to share a secret key to encrypt messages with your friend <strong>Bob</strong>. Normally, you would establish it by communicating with the other party, but you are concerned that someone
                    might be <strong>listening</strong> or even <strong>collecting your communications</strong> for the future. Current methods rely on <strong>hard mathematical problems</strong> that today's computers cannot solve in a reasonable amount
                    of time, but this may eventually change with the development of <strong>quantum computers</strong> üßÆ. However, <strong>quantum physics</strong> offers a new approach that can <strong>spot an eavesdropper in action</strong>. It‚Äôs called
                    <strong>BB84</strong> üîê and it doesn‚Äôt just protect your messages ‚Äî <strong>it tells you if someone tried to spy on it</strong>.</p>

                <p>You can use tiny light particles called <strong>photons</strong> üîÜ to help Bob build it with you, bit by bit. Before sending a photon, you <strong>randomly</strong> pick a way to prepare it ‚Äî such as what information it carries and what
                    kind of <strong>sunglasses üï∂Ô∏è</strong> Bob should look at it with. Bob receives the photon from you and, unaware of your choice, also <strong>randomly</strong> picks sunglasses to look at the photon. If he chooses the same thing as
                    you, he sees what he was supposed to. If not, he might get a different outcome.</p>

                <p>Later, they compare which <strong>sunglasses</strong> they used and keep only the results where they matched ‚úÖ. After many attempts, this gives them a <strong>shared secret</strong> ‚Äî a key they can use to encrypt messages üîë.</p>

                <p>Now comes the twist: If someone tries to intercept the photon, they have to <strong>guess</strong> how to look at it. Guess wrong, and they <strong>change the particle</strong> without meaning to ‚ö†Ô∏è. When Bob gets the altered photon, he
                    might see a result that no longer matches what Alice sent. By checking just a few parts of their shared key, Alice and Bob can <strong>spot signs of tampering</strong> and throw away the key if anything looks suspicious.</p>

                <p><strong>BB84 doesn‚Äôt rely on unbreakable math</strong>. It relies on the <strong>rules of quantum physics</strong> ‚Äî where even <strong>observation can leave a trace</strong> üîç. That makes it one of the first methods in history where
                    <strong>security doesn‚Äôt just protect ‚Äî it watches back</strong> üëÅÔ∏è.</p>

            <p>
                A Jupyter notebook can be used to simulate and visualize the differences between QKD and PQC, helping to clear up common misconceptions. By running interactive Python code, users can see how quantum key distribution (like BB84) works step by step, and
                compare it to classical or post-quantum cryptography. This hands-on approach makes abstract concepts more concrete, allowing learners to experiment, visualize key exchanges, and understand why ‚Äúquantum‚Äù doesn‚Äôt always mean ‚Äúquantum-safe.‚Äù
